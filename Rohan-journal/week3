Running out cpu time was one of my biggest problems and my solution to that came from two ideas
one was to split the file into manageble parts and search everyone till we found the password containg file
or too run till it crashes then start from there which is the method i chose. to accomplish this i used the ile seek methodoligy to
make it much easier to start at a specific line and keep going till we ran out of cpu time or found the password.
